The :mod:`ihm.cross_linkers` Python module
==========================================

.. automodule:: ihm.cross_linkers

.. data:: dss

   DSS cross-linker that links a primary amine with another primary amine
   (non-water-soluble).

.. data:: dsg

   DSG cross-linker that links a primary amine with another primary amine
   (non-water-soluble).

.. data:: bs3

   BS3 cross-linker that links a primary amine with another primary amine
   (water-soluble).

.. data:: dsso

   DSSO cross-linker that links a primary amine with another primary amine
   (non-water-soluble). It is similar to DSS but can be cleaved in the gas
   phase using collision-induced dissociation.

.. data:: edc

   EDC cross-linker that links a carboxyl group with a primary amine.

.. data:: dhso

   DHSO (dihydrazide sulfoxide) MS-cleavable cross-linker that links
   carboxyl groups, described in
   `Gutierrez et al, 2016 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02240>`_.

.. data:: bmso

   BMSO (bismaleimide sulfoxide) MS-cleavable cross-linker that links
   cysteines, described in
   `Gutierrez et al, 2018 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01287>`_.

.. data:: sda

   SDA (NHS-Diazirine) (succinimidyl 4,4â€²-azipentanoate) cross-linker that
   links primary amines with nearly any other functional group via
   long-wave UV-light activation.
